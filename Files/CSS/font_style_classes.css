/* 
Our brandâ€™s typographic identity relies heavily on the use of Apercu. 
The alternate primary option is Arial. 
We have selected these options because they work well 
in both digital and print executions.

While Bold can be used for headlines, 
Medium (in uppercase) works well for subheads. 
For body copy on dark backgrounds with white text, 
use Medium for increased readability.
